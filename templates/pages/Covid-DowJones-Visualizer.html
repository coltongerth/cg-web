    <h3>What are you looking at?</h3>
    <h4>This is a visualization of three data sets that span the same date range from January 22, 2020 to March 9, 2023. These dates encompass major events during the beginning, height, and end of the pandemic, which show a comparison of how the rising number of confirmed covid cases, the total physical money stock, and major worldwide COVID19 events had an effect on the closing stock prices of the DowJones.</h4>

    <h3>What were some of the steps involved with this?</h3>
    <h4>First and foremost, I needed data and process it to account for any null values in the datasets and trim the data so they all line up with one another. I used Pandas for this process as it is able to easily parse and update the data provided to it. Originally, there were only two datasets in use, the DowJones data and the COVID 19 data. It wasn't until I spoke with a financial advisor on way to improve my visualization that the M2Real money stock data be utilized as well. Now that the data was ready, I used Plotly to display everything in an interactive graph.</h4>
